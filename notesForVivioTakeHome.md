# Initial Thoughts and Plans
* Let's just start by importing the CSV module and seeing the output in the terminal
* Converting to JSON should probably be last step
* Maybe double check with them on the unit tests?  
* let's double check usage at https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html for docs, seems pretty straight forward 
* note to self, make sure there's no empty lines in the csv files
